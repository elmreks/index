# index


This repo is a living index.

Not a homepage.  
Not a product.  
Not a pitch.

It’s a single page that anchors a moment in time:
- one image
- a timestamp
- the current time
- a few links that matter *right now*

That’s it.

The page is intentionally minimal.  
No framework.  
No analytics.  
No optimization games.

Just presence, context, and pointers.

If you’re here, you probably followed a thread.
If you’re curious, click a link.
If not, that’s fine too.

This index will change over time, slowly and deliberately.

Be useful.  
Be accurate.  
Don’t bullshit.  
Don’t cause harm.
